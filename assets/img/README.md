## hopeful404.png - NEEDS TO BE ADDED

⚠️ **ACTION REQUIRED**: The `hopeful404.png` image needs to be manually downloaded and added to this directory.

**Download from**: https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/188b2157-6cc0-4246-8958-9b0fa7b85ffe

**Description**: A friendly 404 error image showing a cute pink creature peeking through a broken teal cube.

**Instructions**:
1. Download the image from the URL above
2. Save it as `hopeful404.png` in this directory (`/assets/img/`)
3. Verify the image displays correctly on the 404 page at `/404.html`

**Fallback**: The 404.html page includes a fallback to `/assets/images/404_PageNotFound.jpeg` if hopeful404.png is not available, so the site will still function without this image, but the user experience will be better with the correct image.
